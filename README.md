# Aloha Project

This is my first web page and first project, using fresh knowledge acquired at RED academy during the Web Development program. 

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript/jQuery

## Personal Learnings 

This project has certainly provided me a much more solid understanding of specially HTML and CSS, and how many nice features I can include on my page just using markup language, stylesheet and simple Javascript/jQuery. Definately looking forward to improve my current knowledge and keep developing and amplifying my skills in order to build awesome, accessible, responsive and interactive websites.
